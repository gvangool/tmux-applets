 * tmux-cpu-freq  -  show cpu frequencies as coloured boxes


tmux-cpu-freq
-------------

	Usage (in ~/.tmux.conf):
		set-status-right "#(/path/to/tmux-cpu-freq <number-of-cpus>)"
		set-status-interval 1

Or, you can edit NUMBER_CPUS in tmux-cpu-freq.c before compiling it.

You can also customise the colours by editing the level_colours array,
and adjusting MAX_LEVEL_COLOURS if need be.

The reason this configuration is static is since tmux must run the applet
every frequency interval, thus speed is paramount.
